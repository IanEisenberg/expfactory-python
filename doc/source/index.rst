The Experiment Factory
======================

The Experiment Factory is an effort to standardize, organize, and collaboratively develop experiments that can be run on multiple infrastructures. Currently supported is generating experiments in a battery intended to run with `psiturk <https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk>`_. on Amazon Mechanical Turk or in a standard web browser. These repos store, document, and deploy these experiments, and github is used to allow for open contribution from the larger community. `expfactory-python <http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-python>`_ is the controller for this infrastructure, and this documentation will guide usage of the tools:
