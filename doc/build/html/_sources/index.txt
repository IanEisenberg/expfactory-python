Psiturk-Python Infrastructure
==================

*under development*

This infrastructure is an effort to standardize, and organize experiments intended to run with the `psiturk infrastructure <https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk>`_. on Amazon Mechanical Turk. These repos store, document, and deploy these experiments, and github is used to allow for open contribution from the larger community. `Psiturk-python <http://www.github.com/psiturk/psiturk-battery>_` is the controller for this infrastructure, and this documentation will guide usage of the tools:
